# Kostym

## What is Kostym and why use it?
Kostym is a solution proposal for better maintainability in projects. Based on the reliable and well tested styling solution [Suit](https://github.com/suitcss/suit). Kostym embraces that way of thinking from the front-end down to the backend. Resulting in code that is contained in a component and therefore modular and maintainable, and in some cases even reusable in other projects.
