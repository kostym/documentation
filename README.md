## What is Kostym and why use it?
Kostym is a solution proposal for better maintainability in projects. Based on the reliable and well tested styling solution [Suit](https://github.com/suitcss/suit).
Kostym embraces that way of thinking from the front-end down to the backend. Resulting in code that is contained in a component and therefore modular and maintainable, and in some cases even reusable in other projects.

## Suit documentations
The whole [Suit documentation](https://github.com/suitcss/suit) is quite large.

This is the essential parts that you should be familiar with:

* [Suit component example](https://github.com/suitcss/suit#example)
* [Suit naming convention](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md)
* [Suit design principles](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/design-principles.md)

## Implementations
